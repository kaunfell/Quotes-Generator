About the project:

This small project is about learning to use GitHub, Git Bash and learning how to make 
a generator that returns lines from two different objects (quotes and names from the 
first object and more info from the other).

Main.js is the first try with arrays with test texts.
Second try is unfortunately lost but the chat.js is the final. It has 3 functions that return random quote from the
object and return it with the name of the author. ChatGPT was used to:
make few changes on how to collect the object keys and create if-else-statements in functions to return the name of the author
after the desired random quote is generated.

Next I am trying to learn how to make HTML pages with JavaScript so I could improve this project. 
I would also like to learn a way to merge the 3 functions.
